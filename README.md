koa-react-poc
-------------

Proof of concept Node.js app using Koa and React

## Notes

- The app doesn't do anything meaningful and includes a load of gubbins - it's just a proof of concept
- Uses react-stamp to compose React components - https://github.com/stampit-org/react-stamp
- Requires a monkey-patched version of [koa-react-view](http://github.com/koajs/react-view) at the time of writing - can be found [here](https://github.com/lukebennett/react-view/commit/f7174e0ecb8accc6770f71fe0ac4c05da1854d0c) pending acceptance of a pull request in the upstream repo

## Usage

```js
npm start

```
